# Binocular

The reason I decided to use the "MIT License" was primarily due to it's compatability with the license being used for the
library which I am using to create this project. As "React.js" uses the MIT license, that is the one I initially turned to. 
In addition to this, the "MIT License" grants developers the ability to use the source code of my project in order to modify
and distribute it on their own. These permissions are all given while insuring my own protection, as this license does not
promise any liability or warranty.
